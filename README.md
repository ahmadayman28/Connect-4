# Connect-4 Game

Welcome to our  **Connect-4 game project**! We are a group of students from the Department of Operations Research and  Decision Support,  Faculty  of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University.

Our goal with this project is to design and implement an  artificial intelligence algorithm  that can play Connect-4, a popular two-player strategy game. With this project, we aim to demonstrate our skills in :
1. **Artificial Intelligence.**  
2. **Programming.** 
3. **Problem-solving.**

We invite you to join us on this exciting journey as we explore the world of artificial intelligence and create a fun and challenging Connect-4 game. Follow along with our progress and see how we tackle the complex problem of building an AI that can compete with human players.

Thank you for your interest in our project, and we hope you enjoy playing our Connect-4 game as much as we enjoyed creating it!

## Project Description

Our project focuses on implementing an  artificial intelligence agent  for the Connect-4 board game using Python 3 programming language. The goal of this project is to develop an  AI agent  that can play against a human player and demonstrate our skills in programming, problem-solving, and artificial intelligence.

The project includes the following tasks:

1.  Implement an AI agent for the Connect-4 board game that can play against a human player. The agent should use the  Minimax algorithm  to make its moves.
2.  In the case of Python, the game will be a computer vs. agent game.
3.  Attached is an example for a Connect-4 project setup in Python, that takes input from the game and performs actions based on your selected column. You can find the example project at  [http://kevinshannon.com/connect4/](http://kevinshannon.com/connect4/). Feel free to use it and continue based on it, or you can choose another  board game  as the basis for your project.
4.  Refine the AI agent using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm to improve its performance and efficiency.
5.  Implement a GUI that allows the user to select the  algorithm type  and  difficulty level  of the game.

## Code Files

The following are the five code files included in our Connect-4 Game AI Agent project:

1.  board-class.py  - This file contains the implementation of the Connect-4 game board class, which handles the game board and players' moves.
    
2.  evaluate_window.py  - This file contains the implementation of the  heuristic evaluation function  that is used to evaluate each possible move's value.
    
3.  minmax.py  - This file contains theimplementation of the  Minimax  algorithm, which the  AI  agent uses to make its moves.
    
4.  score_position.py  - This file contains the implementation of the function that scores each possible move based on its position on the  game board, which is used by the evaluation function.
    
5.  gui.py  - This file contains the implementation of the  graphical user interface  (GUI) that allows the user to select the algorithm type and difficulty level of the game.

## Game Rules

Connect-4 is a two-player strategy game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The goal of the game is to connect four of your colored discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

## Installation

To run the code for this project, you will need to have  Python 3  installed on your computer. You will also need to install the  `pygame`  library, which can be installed using the following command:

Copy

```
pip install pygame

```

## Usage

To use the code for this project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the required dependencies as described in the Installation section.
3.  Run the  `gui.py`  file using the following command:

Copy

```
python gui.py

```

4.  Select the algorithm type and difficulty level of the game using the GUI.
5. Go to  [http://kevinshannon.com/connect4/](http://kevinshannon.com/connect4/)
6.  Play the game against the AI agent!

## Results

Our AI agent performs well against human players and is able to win a significant portion of the games it plays. We evaluated the performance of our agent using win/loss ratios and found that it consistently outperformed human players.

## Conclusion

In this project, we implemented an AI agent for the Connect-4 board game using  Python 3 programming language  and demonstrated our skills in programming, problem-solving, and artificial intelligence. Our agent performs well against human players and is a fun and challenging opponent to play against.

We believe that this project provides a strong foundation for future work in game-playing AI systems and can be used as a starting point for developing more advanced algorithms and strategies. Thank you for your interest in our project, and we hope you enjoy playing our Connect-4 game as much as we enjoyed creating it!
